title: CS371P Week Fifteen
---

__What did I do this week?__ This past week, I had an assignment due Thursday afternoon in Information Retrieval and Web Search, and I had an assignment due Friday night in Finance. Additionally, and most stressfully, I had an exam in this class on Thursday night.

__What will you do next week?__ I have an exam in algorithms on Monday, and I have an on site interview on Friday. 

__What’s in your way?__ I only have one final exam, and it’s on the last day of finals, so I have about a week to claim nothing is in my way and ignore studying while everyone else is cramming. 

__Tip of the week__ Take Professor Downing’s Object Oriented Programming class if you haven’t already.

__My experience with the class__ This class will go down as the first college class in which I made it to every lecture, although I did miss one quiz when I was a little too late to class once :|. I loved the exposure to dev tools that we received, and the exposure to design concepts was absolutely invaluable. Additionally, I love that this class offers so much exposure to C++. The language is so powerful and complex that I think it’s a bit difficult to learn individually, but professor Downing’s lectures are really fantastic for showing us how to use the language and why the language has some of the features that it does. I wasn’t a big fan of project 2, but other than that one, I enjoyed all the projects. I didn’t really like the 10PM deadline on the projects, as I always found my partner and I would underestimate how much we had left, and then we would be under quite a bit of pressure to finish in time, but this is really more my fault than the deadline’s fault. The extra credit also made it easier to still get a decent grade on the projects even if you had to turn a project in a day late. I thought the tests were very pretty fair, and the grading on the first one seemed very reasonable. I think I preferred test 2, as I felt some of the questions on test 1 were more trivial than the questions on test 2, but I actually ended up finishing test 2 with more time left than I had after test 1, although I reviewing my code until the time expired anyway. All in all, this class was definitely worth taking, and I’ll be recommending it to everyone I know in the department. Thanks for the great experience, Professor Downing!
