title: CS373 Week Seven
---

__What did I do this week?__ This last week we had a test in this class, SWE, which went alright for me, though it was really different from what I had expected. After taking OOP last semester, I was expecting a very similar exam, but it actually ended up resembling the quizzes more closely. 

__What’s in your way?__ I don’t really have anything in my way right now. I have a programming for performance assignment due on Tuesday, but my partner and I have done a pretty good portion of it already, so I don’t think finishing it is really going to be too much of a problem.

__What will you do next week?__ Next week I’ll finish up the programming for performance assignment I have due on Tuesday and do my software design programming assignment that’s due on Saturday, I think, over the course of the week.

__What's your experience of the class?__ I think the material of the class is useful and fairly interesting. It’s been pretty cool to see some of the features that Python has; I’ve so far found argument packing and unpacking to be the most interesting features that Professor Downing has shown us. I thought the exam was pretty fair for the most part. I think some of the “What is the output?” quiz questions that we’ve been given are a little obscure and specific, requiring us to remember a very small detail about Python, but I thought all of the questions on the test were about more significant features of Python.

__Tip of the Week:__ If you’re having trouble coming up with a tip of the week while making your blog post, try to come up with a tip about coming up with a tip of the week.
