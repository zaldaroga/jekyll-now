title: CS373 Week Five
---

__What did I do this week?__ This week, I was pretty until Thursday night. To begin the week, I had a programming for performance assignment due Tuesday night that I struggled a little bit with finishing on time. Then, I had a test on Thursday, a homework assignment for software design due Thursday night, Netflix for this class due Thursday night, and a software design project due Saturday night. I didn’t really do anything besides programming for performance on Monday and Tuesday, and then Wednesday I spent most of my time on Netflix. After having done the project in C++ a semester ago, in OOP, I found this one considerably easier, and my partner and I ended up finishing it pretty quickly. The next day, I started on the software design homework, and I ended up finishing that pretty quickly, too, so my partner and I got started on the project for that class, and we ended up finishing that within a few hours, which left me with no assignments to do pretty much until the end of the weekend, giving me a pretty nice break from school with the exception of attending one class (this one) on Friday morning.

__What’s in your way?__ Next week, I have a test in software design on Thursday, but other than that, nothing is really in my way right now.

__What will you do next week?__ I have a homework assignment in software design that I’ll be doing on Monday, and I have a test in the same class on Thursday, but other than that, I can’t really think of anything else that I have to do.

__What's your experience of the class?__ My experience of the class still hasn’t changed very much; I really enjoy Professor Downing’s teaching style, and I think the material is useful and interesting. 

__Tip of the Week:__ If you're feeling lazy, sit down and play the type of music you'd hear on sixth street. It'll really pipe you up again.
