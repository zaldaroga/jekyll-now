title: CS371P Week One
---

__What did I do this week?__ I thought this week went by incredibly fast, which I guess I should have expected given that it was a shorter week than usual. Most of my time this week was spent on the first assignments of the year for this class and Algorithms.  Both assignments were considerably easier than I expected, but I’m sure the next assignments will be harder. Unfortunately, I was a little less proactive with starting these assignments as I should have been, but I plan to turn that around this week.

__What’s in your way?__ This last week I was a lot less consistent about going to the gym as I was over the summer and during the week before it, and I think that had a lot to do with the fact that I procrastinated a bit, which forced me to put a large portion of Tuesday and Wednesday to finish them. I don’t plan to let that happen again this week or any other week

__What will you do next week?__ Next week I plan to get started on the second project for the class and continue doing the readings. I also still need to update my resume for the career fair coming up soon. I am looking forward to doing the next project in pairs because I think it’s a lot more fun to work with other people, unless my partner does something like not show up every time we’re supposed to meet up or is completely uninvolved in the process.

__Tip of the Week:__ I think it’s a really good idea to split large projects into small pieces that you can mark off a list (or mark as closed on an issue list in GitHub). I used to put “Finish five questions for physics” on a to-do list so that I was more inclined to start the homework than I would’ve been if I had to finish all of it before marking something complete.
