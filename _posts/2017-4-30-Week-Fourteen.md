title: CS373 Week Fourteen
---

__What did I do this week?__ This week was pretty relaxed. Unfortunately, I failed to finish the software design assignment during the last week, so my partner and I are going to have to finish that on Monday or Tuesday of next week, but we still managed to put a pretty good amount of work in on it. We also had to prepare our IDB presentation, which didn’t take very long but it still required us to get together and work one last time. I’m looking forward to presenting on Monday and finally being finished with the project.

__What’s in your way?__ I wouldn’t really say anything is in my way right now. I have three tests on Thursday, but I’m not really that concerned about any of them, and I need to finish the software design assignment, but it’s still not really something in my way.

__What will you do next week?__ Next week, I’m going to finish my software design assignment, and my group is going to present our IDB presentation on Monday. Other than that, I’ll probably try to get some studying done for my three tests, but I probably won’t really do much besides make a cheat sheet for the exams that allow it. 

__What's your experience of the class?__ My experience of the class is still overall very positive. I have really enjoyed the work that we’ve done to this point, and I can say that I have definitely had a good experience in this class. The class is definitely not as intensive as it has been described, and the grading is definitely very fair. 

__Tip of the Week:__ In the words of Kendrick Lamar, “Sit down; be humble.”
