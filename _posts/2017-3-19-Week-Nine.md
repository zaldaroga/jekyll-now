title: CS373 Week Nine
---

__What did I do this week?__ Most of this week was spent on the first portion of the SWE project, IDB. We had planned to do get a good portion of work done over Spring Break, but obviously we put a lot more faith in ourselves than we should have, so we found ourselves with only the database stuff done when spring break came to a close. However, my group and I found that we very capable of working together. Our group did a lot of pair programming, which I usually find very difficult with more than two people, but we managed to stay effective, and we found ourselves plowing through all of our issues at a pretty insane rate. Additionally, I had a test on Tuesday in programming for performance. Going into the week, I had thought the test was on Thursday, so it came as a bit of a shock on Monday night when I found out I had a test the next day. Luckily, the test was open note, so I didn’t need to commit everything to memory and instead ensured that my notes were as complete as possible (read: literally had the entire course material) and that I had some understanding of it all. I think it went fairly well, and after that I was more available to work on IDB.

__What’s in your way?__ I have a programming for performance assignment due next Tuesday, and I have done far less than I should have so far, so it’ll be interesting to see whether or not my partner and I will be able to get it done in time. I don’t think it seems that difficult to complete, but we’re having a pretty hard time getting ourselves to start, and I feel like that’s a pretty essential step to finishing any project.

__What will you do next week?__ Next week I’ll be working on programming for performance until Tuesday night, and then I’ll spend a small amount of time preparing for my Foundations of Management test on Thursday, and then I’ll split the rest of my time between whatever I need to do for Software Design next week and working on the next portion of IDB. 

__What's your experience of the class?__ I enjoyed the first portion of the IDB and all of the technologies involved; I also really like the idea of working in a fairly large team because I think these sizes are a little closer to team sizes we’re more likely to experience in the work force than the team sizes in most classes.

__Pick of the Week:__ If you’re looking to browse YouTube videos without actually going on YouTube, be sure to check out [YouTubeSWEg](www.youtubesweg.me). I'd like to think it offers a stellar and immersive user experience.
