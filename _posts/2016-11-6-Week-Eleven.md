title: CS371P Week Eleven
---

__What did I do this week?__ This past week was the most stressful I’ve had in a while. I had an algorithms exam on Wednesday, followed by project four due on Thursday in this class. I had planned to get started early with my partner, but we did not get as much done in advance as we would have liked, so we were a little stressed as we were working to get it done on time. Unfortunately, I was very careless when I was comparing our output to that of other students on Piazza, and I ended up comparing it to an older version that was incorrect. We had a bug that affected the output quite a bit over the course of 1000 moves, so we compared our 100 move output to that of another group, which had us wrongly searching for a second bug, when we actually already had the correct output. Once we finally figured out that we were searching for a bug that didn’t exist, we were sadly already late to turn in our project.

__What’s in your way?__ I don’t have very much in my way right now. My partner and I need to get started on project 5, and I have an assignment due in my Info Retrieval and Web Search class a couple days before project 5 is due, but I’m planning to get the Info Retrieval project done early.

__What will you do next week?__ It’s looking like I’ll have a pretty easy week coming up. I don’t have any tests for the rest of the month, actually, and I don’t have any projects due this week. Additionally, I don’t even have algorithms homework due this Wednesday. I have a couple due the week after that, but I’m not too worried about getting them done on time.

__Tip of the week__ Don’t be careless with what you’re comparing your output to. Don’t waste as many hours as we did debugging a problem that wasn’t there. Also, don't be as careless as I was with forgetting to publish my blog until several days after Sunday.
