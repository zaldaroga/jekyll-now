title: CS373 Week Eight
---

__What did I do this week?__ This week was pretty easy for me. I had an assignment due on Tuesday night in programming for performance, which was a little annoying because sometimes my jobs would stay in the queue for Stampede for a very long time, typically longer than the time it would’ve taken me to run my code locally. Other than that assignment, I didn’t really have very much to do during the week, so I didn’t do very much else during the week.

__What’s in your way?__ The first phase of the big project in this class is due on the Thursday after spring break ends, so that’s kind of a bummer, but I feel like my group is pretty strong, so I doubt we’re going to struggle much. I doubt we’ll get much done during spring break, but once we get back, we’ll probably get going and knock the assignment out fairly swiftly. I also have a programming for performance test on Thursday, which I’m a little nervous about, but the professor gave us quite a bit of information about it, and it’s open note, so I think it’ll go reasonably well. I’m a little more stressed out about the programming for performance assignment due the Tuesday after that, because those always take too much time to get started.

__What will you do next week?__ Next week is spring break, which is pretty cool. I’m planning to go back to Houston for a couple days to go to a friend’s birthday party and the rodeo, which I think is a very overrated and overpriced event, but my friends and I go every year, and I never want to look like the lame friend that doesn’t want to participate. After that, I’m returning to Austin on Monday, and some of my friends and I are planning to go to Taos, New Mexico to ski for three days. 

__What's your experience of the class?__ I still really enjoy this class and the material that’s covered. I’m especially excited about experiencing all the technologies involved in the main project.
