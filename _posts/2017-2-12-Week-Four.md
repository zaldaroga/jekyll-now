title: CS373 Week Four
---

__What did I do this week?__ This week was not too intensive, but I didn’t do quite as much as I should have. I had an assignment in programming for performace due Tuesday night that I struggled to get done in time, so I didn’t really do any other work until after that, and then the next things I had a homework assignment and a programming assignment due on Friday and Saturday, respectively. My partner and I finished the programming assignment on Wednesday quicker than we expected, given how much time we’d taken for the other assignments, and I finished the homework on Thursday. After that, I had wanted to get started on Netflix, but the next programming for performance assignment had already been released and was due on Tuesday, so I started to get to work on that assignment instead.

__What’s in your way?__ Finishing up my programming for performance homework is what I think is most in my way right now. After having done Netflix last semester, in OOP, I’m pretty confident it won’t be all that time consuming.

__What will you do next week?__ Next week I have a fairly busy week. As I mentioned a couple times above, I have an assignment due in programming for performance due Tuesday night, the Netflix assignment is due Thursday night for this class, I have software design homework due on Thursday night as well, a software design programming assignment due Friday night, homework assignments due Tuesday and Thursday in my Foundations of Management class, and a test Thursday in the same class. I’ll probably spend most of the first couple days between programming for performance, Netflix, and Foundations of Management, and then I’ll probably finish Netflix and the software design homework on Wednesday, and finally, I’ll try to knock out the software design project on Friday.

__What's your experience of the class?__ My experience of professor Downing’s class has not changed. I still think the coding practices that professor Downing tries to instill in us are invaluable, and I think the class material is worthwhile and helpful.

__Pick of the Week:__ Future’s releasing a new album this week, and though I haven’t heard it yet, I can only expect great things from the lyricist of our generation.
