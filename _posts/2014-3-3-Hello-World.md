_What did I do this week?_ Professor Downing seems to, thankfully, be the type of professor that is not a fan of wasting time. Day one in his class introduced a few significant differences between C++ and Java, and it was clear from the beginning that we would have to work hard to do well in this class. The most distinct part of Professor Downing’s class was him calling on students from his roster randomly. Very few of my professors since coming to college have shown that level of interest in our performance as individuals, so I’m rather excited to have a professor that seems to care so much for our performance as individuals.

_What’s in your way?_ I don’t have very much experience with C++, so although I don’t think I’m the only one that’s never touched that language, I feel like I have a bit more in my way than the folks that have had a bit of experience with the language. It seems to be a bit more different from Java than C is, so I think the learning curve might be as high or higher than that of learning to use C after Java. The primary obstacle when moving to C from Java was pointer arithmetic, but so far it seems that C++ has a few other differences that I’m going to have to get used to. Despite it being an obstacle, though, I’m really looking forward to experiencing a new language.

_What will you do next week?_ During the first week of school, which usually isn’t a full five days, I tend to find myself doing a lot less than I should, but that laziness isn’t something that I allow myself to extend past that first week. Now that the first week of school is over, I’m planning to stay ahead of class, partially so that I don’t get embarrassed by being unprepared if Professor Downing cold calls me, but mostly so that I can stay prepared for this upcoming semester.
