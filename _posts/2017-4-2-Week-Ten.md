title: CS373 Week Nine
---

__What did I do this week?__ This week was a particularly stressful one for me, mostly due to my programming for performance assignment that was due on Tuesday but was turned in on Thursday. My partner and I really struggled with the various optimizations for matrix-matrix-multiply that we were required to implement, and we struggled with obtaining wrong answers after we were so sure we had implemented some of them correctly. Luckily, Professor Pingali has a pretty light penalty for late work, so we took an extra two days to submit our assignment. Aside from programming for performance, I had a test in foundations of management and a software design assignment. The software design assignment only took a couple hours, so it was really just a mild irritant, and the foundations of management test was also only a little concerning. Most of the terms are pretty self explanatory, so it only took a small amount of studying to get a pretty good grade.

__What’s in your way?__ IDB part 2 is probably the biggest thing in my way right now. I also have a programming for performance assignment and a software design test on the same day as IDB is due, so I’ll need to be proactive with getting work done early in the week so I’m not pressed for time later in the week

__What will you do next week?__ Next week I will get started on IDB part 2 with my group. We probably should’ve started sooner, but it’s too late to do that now. I have a lot of confidence in my group and our ability to get things done, though, so I’m sure we’ll do fine. At some point, I also need to get my programming for performance assignment done. It isn’t as long as the other assignments have been, but I’m still pretty concerned about it. Additionally, I have to find some time to study for software design.

__What's your experience of the class?__ I like the material that Professor Downing is covering now. I feel like most of it is stuff that we are expected to know, at least to some extent, as computer science majors, so some of it is already familiar material, but all of it is useful material.

__Tip of the Week:__ My tip of the week is to be thorough when reading instructions. When setting up GCP, my partners and I tended to skim quickly to the next instruction without reading everything, and it ended up costing us a pretty large amount of time when we ran into an issue later.
