title: CS371P Week Thirteen
---

__What did I do this week?__ This past week we talked more about dynamic binding and casting in C++. We continued using the example of the Shapes as classes, and we talked some about the advantages of using abstract classes. Also, on Thursday, project five was due for this class. Unfortunately, my partner and I didn’t manage to get the assignment turned in on time. It only took us an extra hour of work to fix our issue, which was somewhat bittersweet. On one hand, it was nice that we didn’t end up working far past the deadline, but it was also disappointing that we could’ve saved ourselves several points by spending an extra hour working prior to the deadline. Anyway, I’m pretty happy to be done with the projects for this class. I enjoyed doing them, but I won’t miss the stress on Thursday afternoons trying to get it done before 10.

__What’s in your way?__ I suppose I should spend some time during this upcoming week studying for the OOP exam the Thursday after we get back from the break, and I think my last algorithms exam is the Monday after that, so maybe I should spend some time preparing for that too. I also have to resist the urge to overeat and eat unhealthily overall over the break. 

__What will you do next week?__ I don’t think anyone needs a reminder that next week is Thanksgiving break. For what I think is the first time since I’ve been at UT, we have Wednesday off during this coming week. This unfortunately might make it a little harder to remember to turn in my algorithms homework on Wednesday. I plan to get it done on Monday before going back to my parent’s place because the chances of me forgetting to do it at that point are actually pretty high.

__Tip of the week__ If you go for a run before your Thanksgiving meal, you’ll probably be more likely to resist overeating because you won’t want to waste the entire run. If you still end up overeating, at least you can feel good about the fact that you went for a run earlier.
