title: CS371P Week Twelve
---

__What did I do this week?__ This past week was rather relaxed for me. I actually didn’t have any work due last week, and so I had the opportunity to get a head start on my projects that are due next week. However, I failed to take advantage of that opportunity, so now I’ll probably be fairly stressed out next week as I try to get everything done on time. In class this week, we spent a pretty large amount of time talking about inheritance and the intricacies of C++ with regards to method overriding and inheriting attributes. I appreciate the way Professor Downing introduces some of the less intuitive features of the language, because there seem to be many key differences between inheritance in C++ and Java, so it’s helpful to be shown those features before running into problems while working.

__What’s in your way?__ Next week I have a fair amount to do, now that I failed to get head starts on my projects. On Tuesday, I have an assignment due in Info Retrieval and Web Search, I have an algorithms assignment due Wednesday after a two week break, and I have an assignment due in this class on Thursday. I plan to finish the Info Retrieval assignment tonight, on Sunday, but then again, I also planned to get a decent amount done last week.

__What will you do next week?__ Next week I will try to get all my work done before it’s due. I don’t really think I’ll struggle too much with getting all of it done on time, but it’s definitely not going to be as relaxed of a week as the last one was.

__Tip of the week__ Be on the lookout for a good tip/pick of the week during the week, so you don’t spend several minutes searching “tips for success” or “life tips” on Google before you can post your blog for the week.
