title: CS371P Week Five
---

__What did I do this week?__ This week had I assignments due in three different classes that I didn’t start until the last minute, and I also ended up pretty sick this week, so I’m very glad the week is over now. Career fair is also always pretty exhausting, so I didn’t get much work done on Tuesday after returning home, so I dug myself into an even deeper hole of work that needed to get done in a short period of time. To make matters worse, Wednesday and Thursday were the days that I was most sick, so when I had the least amount of time left, I was in the lowest state of productivity. Of course, that stressfulness could’ve been avoided if I’d been more proactive about getting my work done and meeting up with my partner earlier. This week in class, Professor Downing showed us some more examples in which iterators were used to develop functions, and on Wednesday, we had a speaker talk to us about his work at JPL.

__What’s in your way?__ I don’t have very much in my way this week. I have a test in Algorithms on Wednesday that I need to get some studying done for, but I don’t think that will really block me from getting other work done this week. The test in this class is coming up the week after that, I believe, so I’ll have ample time to prepare for the two tests separately from each other.

__What will you do next week?__ Next week I plan to study for Algorithms through the first half of the week and then start studying for the OOP exam that I believe follows it about a week later. I also need to do some studying for Info Retrieval and Web Search because I missed class both days this week, one for the career fair and one while I was sick. 

__Tip of the Week:__ Don’t forget to pass by reference! While working on Netflix, my partner and I had initially forgotten to pass our caches, which were saved in maps, by reference, so the program was painfully slow before we finally realized we were missing ampersands. Making a copy of a large map every time we wanted to make a prediction was definitely not a good way to write a program.
