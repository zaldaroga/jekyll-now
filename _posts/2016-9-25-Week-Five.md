title: CS371P Week Five
---

__What did I do this week?__ This week, on Monday and Friday, Professor Downing talked a lot about pointers and references, showing us how, in many cases, a reference is s better option because issues are more likely to cause compile time errors than runtime errors or unexpected behavior. Prior to this class, I’d heard of references in C++, but I had no real knowledge about their advantage or usage. We also learned a fair amount about arrays in and about how comparing the contents of two arrays is implemented in C++. My partner and I got started on Netflix this week. We updated our makefile and were hoping to get a successful Travis build the day we started, but an issue kept us from getting a build to start. Another classmate, however, got the issue resolved by contacting their support team. 

__What’s in your way?__ This week, I’d say the things in my way are recruiting season and Boost. I enjoy going to the career fair, and I also sometimes enjoy interviewing, but there’s no denying that it’s stressful and time consuming. This next summer will probably be my last internship, so I’d like for it to be at a place that I really like and could see myself working at after graduation. With regards to Boost, I’m looking forward to figuring out how it works, but getting it set up seems like it will take a non-trivial amount of effort.

__What will you do next week?__ Next week I will finish up the Netflix project, along with my Algorithms homework for the week and my Info Retrieval and Web Search homework. Of course the career fair is also on my to do list for this week, and this year I may be able to spend the entire time there, which I haven’t been able to do for any of the other four career fairs I’ve been at UT for. 

__Tip of the Week:__ Though I admittedly tend to not heed this advice, I think it’s really important to keep resumes on hand at all times. You might not always remember when your favorite company is having an event at the GDC, or you might forget to bring resumes that day, but if you always have a few spares with you, you won’t miss a good opportunity.
