title: CS371P Week Two
---

__What did I do this week?__ This week, my biggest fear in this class was realized: Professor Downing called on me to answer a question. I was absolutely terrified. By some miracle, I managed to force out the right answer and then Professor Downing moved on to his next victim. All joking aside, though, as intimidating as it can be to get called on to answer a question in class, it really forces you to stay engaged in class, which I have struggled with in the past. This week I finally finalized my schedule by picking up a number theory class that was restricted until Tuesday. With regards to OOP, this week we received our first assignment, Collatz. The assignment seems reasonably straight forward, and I’m excited to see how close I’ll end up to my timing estimate at the end of the project. This week Professor Downing taught us about how Exceptions work in C++, and I really liked the way he examined potential alternatives and their downfalls.

__What’s in your way?__ I think right now the biggest blocker in my way is getting ready for recruiting season for next summer. I have yet to update my resume from last school year, so I need to set some time aside to update that and do some interview preparation.

__What will you do next week?__ As I mentioned above, I’ll need to set more time aside to update my resume and practice some interview questions. I also need to do quite a bit of homework this week. The first assignment in most of my classes is due this week, so I need to get those done. I also need to make sure I stay ahead of my readings for my classes. If I fall behind on readings now, I’ll probably never catch up.

__Tip of the Week:__ Learning keyboard shortcuts for the IDEs that I use most frequently has made a huge impact on the efficiency of my work. It’s easier to stay focused if your fingers don’t have to leave the keyboard to do things like finding a file or switching tabs. I know it’s not a super ground breaking or intriguing tip, but I think it’s worth mentioning.
