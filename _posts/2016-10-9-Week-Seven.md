title: CS371P Week Seven
---

__What did I do this week?__ This week was rather relaxed for me. Obviously, I had a test in this class, OOP, and I had an assignment in Info Retrieval, but neither of those really caused me very much stress. The Info Retrieval assignment was fairly simple, so I finished it in a few hours, so I had enough time to prepare for the test, even though I didn’t actually use all of that in a productive manner. I thought the test was very fair. There were six programming questions, one of which was a fair bit more involved than the others, but none of them were too ridiculous. Number five was a little confusing at first, but the unit tests that were included in the description for the question were a big hint. Once I finally came up with a solution it was incredibly satisfying, although I woke up the next day worried that I’d mistyped my solution for operator *(). Additionally, on one of the questions, I was reviewing my work in the last minute of the test, and I accidentally removed a != operator, so now I have a line of code that doesn’t make very much sense. Hopefully I’m wrong about making the former mistake, and I hope they’ll be lenient about the missing !=. 

__What’s in your way?__ I don’t think there’s really anything in my way this week either. I don’t have a test this week, so I don’t have too much studying to do. I have an assignment in algorithms after a two-week break from those, and project 3 in this class has been released, but as of right now, nothing is really blocking me.

__What will you do next week?__ Next week I’ll do my algorithms assignment and probably get started on project 3. I also plan to hit the gym harder than I have the past couple of weeks. I’ve been particularly lazy in that regard recently. I’ll also start studying a bit for my Info Retrieval test on the 18th. I don’t really know what to expect from the tests in that class, so I want to start studying early for it.

__Tip of the Week:__ If the next test has a question like number 7, leave it unanswered until you’re ready to submit the exam. The submit button doesn’t activate until after that question has an answer, so it seems like a good idea to leave it that way, just in case.
