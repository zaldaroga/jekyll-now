title: CS373 Week Eleven
---

__What did I do this week?__ This week was a bit stressful for me because I had a test on Thursday in Software Design, a Programming for Performance assignment due Thursday at midnight, and the second phase of IDB due on Thursday at 10 PM. Of course I decided to ignore my test until Thursday morning, so I didn’t have to spend any time on it during the week, but software engineering required attention throughout the week. As per usual, we didn’t do any work on the project prior to this week. Maybe we’ll get started on the third phase in advance, but to be honest, I seriously doubt it. We do our best work with our backs against the wall. I started my programming for performance assignment with ample time to finish because this one was particularly easy. I spent about 3 hours on Wednesday working on it before my IDB partners showed up and we got working on that, and I finished it up in about an hour after turning in IDB on Thursday. My partners and I ended up pulling an all nighter to finish IDB on Wednesday night, so I took about an hour out during that time to try to prepare for my test, though I would say I was mostly unsuccessful.

__What’s in your way?__ I don’t have too much in my way right now. Nothing huge is due this week.

__What will you do next week?__ I’d like to say next week I’ll get a head start on my next programming for performance assignment, and I’ll meet my SWE group during the week to knock out the third phase of IDB as early as possible. That's probably not true though.

__What's your experience of the class?__ As I said last week, I like the material that Professor Downing is covering now. I feel like most of it is stuff that is useful even if some of it is already familiar.

__Tip of the Week:__ If you’re planning to stay very late at the GDC (or on campus in general), keep a jacket with you in case you want to take a nap. It’s a lot less comfortable to sleep when you’re cold.
