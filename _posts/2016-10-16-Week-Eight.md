title: CS371P Week Eight
---

__What did I do this week?__ This week in class, we talked quite a bit about vectors and arrays in C++. We discussed the implementation of vectors on Friday, and we talked a bit about how arrays could be used on Wednesday. Outside of Professor Downings class, this past week was even more relaxed than the one before for me. My partner and I got started on project 3 for this class, and we found that it seemed easier than the first two. Unless we discover some significant issues with our implementation in the next few days, we’re almost done with the assignment. Aside from working on that assignment, I had to finish an algorithms assignment, but after Wednesday, that assignment was finished, so I was left with more than a week before my next assignment. 

__What’s in your way?__ I have a lot more work to do this week than I did last week. I don’t know if I’d say anything is really in my way, though. None of the work is something I don’t know how to do, and I have a decent start on almost every assignment. I haven’t started the algorithms assignment for the week, so I think that’s the assignment that’s blocking me the most right now, but I typically don’t start on that assignment in advance. It might be a bit harder this week, though, because the earlier weeks in the class were easier than this past week

__What will you do next week?__ Next week I have a bit of work to do, but I’m not too stressed about it. I need to start and finish the algorithms assignment, take a test in info retrieval, and finish the OOP project. All of those things are on different days, though, so I think I should be able to space them out reasonably well. 

__Tip of the week__ I know it isn't a groundbreaking tip, but get enough sleep when you can. As students we tend to compromise with sleep a lot, but it really isn't worth the negative side effects that come along with it, like a weakened immune system.
