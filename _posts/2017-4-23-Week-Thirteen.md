title: CS373 Week Thirteen
---

__What did I do this week?__ This week ended up working out a lot better than I expected. We ended up finishing phase three of IDB considerably faster than the previous two phases, and we ended up managing to wrap the entire assignment up on Wednesday night just after the submission opened up on Canvas. This left me with pretty much all day to finish up my programming for performance assignment. My partner and I had put in a pretty good amount of work leading up to Thursday, but I was still a little uncertain we would finish on time. Unfortunately for me, my partner was stuck finishing up his SWE project for most of the day, so I had to put quite a bit of work in on that assignment on my own. I ended up making a couple of mistakes with some of the job submissions to Stampede, so some of them had to be edited and resubmitted, but all of the results were in around when my partner turned in his SWE project, and then we were able to spend the next couple of hours finishing up the report for the assignment. 

__What’s in your way?__ Now that I have finished the last assignments for my two most intensive classes, I just need to finish up the lighter ones. I think I have an assignment in Foundations of Management due some time next week, and I have a Software Design assignment due the last week of classes, I think. I’ve heard this is the hardest software design assignment of the semester, but I still don’t really think either assignment is really a huge stressor. I think the biggest thing in my way right now is the three tests I have on the same day on the last Thursday of the semester.

__What will you do next week?__ I plan to get both of my remaining assignments done pretty early in the week so that I can get to studying for my tests as early as possible. I’m not that scared of any of them, but any time tests align on the same day, it’s a bit nerve wrecking. 

__What's your experience of the class?__ I’m still really enjoying the design pattern and refactoring lessons. Refactorings and design patterns can be so useful, so I’m happy to get this second exposure to them after also covering the same topics in software design earlier this semester. 

__Tip of the Week:__ Get familiar with using a debugger, especially when writing C or C++ code. It’s pretty easy to have a big memory bug in both of those languages, and tracking down the source of it can be pretty difficult with just print statements.
