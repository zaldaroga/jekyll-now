__What's your experience of the class?__ My experience of this class is overall very positive. Professor Downing gives lectures that are engaging and interactive, and the projects are worthwhile. The grading is very fair, and the TAâ€™s are always very accessible and quick to respond. Professor Downing is one of the professors that shows that he cares about his students and their performance in his class. The main project in the class, which is completed over three phases, is a great project because it forces us to work like an agile development team to get all of the components working, and communication is so important to get all of the components integrated with each other. Overall, it was a very rewarding experience. I would highly recommend this class to anyone. The class is interesting, and the material is invaluable.
